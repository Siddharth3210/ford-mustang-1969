2. `mustang-front.jpg` - Front view of the Mustang
3. `mustang-side.jpg` - Side profile of the Mustang
4. `mustang-rear.jpg` - Rear view showing the iconic tail lights
5. `mustang-engine.jpg` - Engine bay shot
6. `mustang-interior.jpg` - Interior/dashboard shot

8. `specs-bg.jpg` - Background image for specs section

Please add high-quality images of a 1969 Ford Mustang to this directory. For the best visual effect, choose dark, dramatic images that fit the mafia/noir theme. Images with dark backgrounds or shot at night with selective lighting work particularly well.

You can find suitable images on stock photo websites or classic car photography collections. Ensure you have the right to use any images added to this project.
